This app was created as a intro to my Career at Centene before I understood how apps scale/work. This was a 1 week or less project created in 2019.
It started as an app about 1 person but grew over time with more functionality which caused naming convention confusion. (All my beginner mistakes are still present)



## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

I hav'nt ran the project in about a year so there needs to be changes to make it operational again

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
